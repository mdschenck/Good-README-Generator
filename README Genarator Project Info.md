# Usage:

Upon launching the application, the user is presented with a series of promts to enter the project information. Prompts include: Project title, Description, Link to Deployed Application, Useage, Collaborators, Screenshot, and License requested. Once all the information is complete, the application generates a README.md file in the directory that takes the user's input and formats it in Markup correctly to present a well designed README.md document that can be included in the project.
